read_rnd_buffer_size	This variable is used for reads from MyISAM tables, and, for any storage engine, for Multi-Range Read optimization. When reading rows from a MyISAM table in sorted order following a key-sorting operation, the rows are read through this buffer to avoid disk seeks. Setting the variable to a large value can improve ORDER BY performance by a lot.
sort_buffer_size	Each session that must perform a sort allocates a buffer of this size.
thread_pool_size	The number of thread groups in the thread pool. 
myisam_max_sort_file_size	The maximum size of the temporary file that MySQL is permitted to use while recreating a MyISAM index. If the file size would be larger than this value, the index is created using the key cache instead, which is slower. If MyISAM index files exceed this size and disk space is available, increasing the value may help performance.
binlog_cache_size	The size of the memory buffer to hold changes to the binary log during a transaction. If you often use large transactions, you can increase this cache size to get better performance by reducing or eliminating the need to write to temporary files. 
binlog_stmt_cache_size	The size of the memory buffer for the binary log to hold nontransactional statements issued during a transaction. If you often use large nontransactional statements during transactions, you can increase this cache size to get better performance by reducing or eliminating the need to write to temporary files.

If you have a high end I/O subsystem and you see more than 64 × INNODB_read_io_threads pending read requests in SHOWENGINE INNODB STATUS output, you might improve performance by increasing the value of INNODB_read_io_threads.
innodb_thread_concurrency	INNODB tries to keep the number of operating system threads concurrently inside INNODB less than or equal to the limit given by this variable. Once the number of threads reaches this limit, additional threads are placed into a wait state within a First In, First Out (FIFO) queue for execution.

H2StreamMaxMemSize	This directive sets the maximum number of outgoing data bytes buffered in memory for an active streams. This memory is not allocated per stream as such. Allocations are counted against this limit when they are about to be done. Stream processing freezes when the limit has been reached and will only continue when buffered data has been sent out to the client.

LDAPSharedCacheSize	Specifies the number of bytes to allocate for the shared memory cache. The default is 500kb. If set to 0, shared memory caching will not be used and every HTTPD process will create its own cache.
MaxKeepAliveRequests	The MaxKeepAliveRequests directive limits the number of requests allowed per connection when KeepAlive is on. If it is set to 0, unlimited requests will be allowed. We recommend that this setting be kept to a high value for maximum server performance.
MaxRequestWorkers	Maximum number of connections that will be processed simultaneously. The MaxRequestWorkers directive sets the limit on the number of simultaneous requests that will be served. Any connection attempts over the MaxRequestWorkers limit will normally be queued, up to a number based on the ListenBacklog directive. Once a child process is freed at the end of a different request, the connection will then be serviced.
ThreadStackSize	The size in bytes of the stack used by threads handling client connections
ThreadsPerChild	This directive sets the number of threads created by each child process. The child creates these threads at startup and never creates more. If using an MPM like mpm_winnt, where there is only one child process, this number should be high enough to handle the entire load of the server. If using an MPM like worker, where there are multiple child processes, the total number of threads should be high enough to handle the common load on the server.
StartThreads	Number of threads created on startup. As the number of threads is dynamically controlled depending on the load, there is usually little reason to adjust this parameter.
StartServers	The StartServers directive sets the number of child server processes created on startup. As the number of processes is dynamically controlled depending on the load, there is usually little reason to adjust this parameter.
SendBufferSize	Sets the server's TCP send buffer size to the number of bytes specified. 
SSLRenegBufferSize	If an SSL renegotiation is required in perlocation context, for example, any use of SSLVerifyClient in a Directory or Location block, then mod_ssl must buffer any HTTP request body into memory until the new SSL handshake can be performed. This directive can be used to set the amount of memory that will be used for this buffer.
ScriptLogBuffer	The size of any PUT or POST entity body that is logged to the file is limited, to prevent the log file growing too big too quickly if large bodies are being received. By default, up to 1024 bytes are logged, but this can be changed with this directive.
RLimitMEM	Takes 1 or 2 parameters. The first parameter sets the soft resource limit for all processes and the second parameter sets the maximum resource limit. Either parameter can be a number, or max to indicate to the server that the limit should be set to the maximum allowed by the operating system configuration. Raising the maximum resource limit requires that the server is running as root or in the initial startup phase.
RLimitCPU	Takes 1 or 2 parameters. The first parameter sets the soft resource limit for all processes and the second parameter sets the maximum resource limit. Either parameter can be a number, or max to indicate to the server that the limit should be set to the maximum allowed by the operating system configuration. Raising the maximum resource limit requires that the server is running as root or in the initial startup phase.
ReceiveBufferSize	The server will set the TCP receive buffer size to the number of bytes specified.
ProxyReceiveBufferSize	The CSELF directive specifies an explicit (TCP/IP) network buffer size for proxied HTTP and FTP connections, for increased throughput. It has to be greater than 512 or set to 0 to indicate that the system's default buffer size should be used.
ProxyIOBufferSize	The CSELF directive adjusts the size of the internal buffer which is used as a scratchpad for the data between input and output. The size must be at least 512. In almost every case, there's no reason to change that value.
ProxyHTMLBufSize	In order to parse non HTML content (stylesheets and scripts) embedded in HTML documents, mod_proxy_html has to read the entire script or stylesheet into a buffer. This buffer will be expanded as necessary to hold the largest script or stylesheet in a page, in increments of bytes as set by this directive. The default is 8192, and will work well for almost all pages. However, if you know you're proxying pages containing stylesheets and scripts bigger than 8K (that is, for a single script or stylesheet, NOT in total), it will be more efficient to set a larger buffer size and avoid the need to resize the buffer dynamically during a request.
ProxyHCTPsize	Sets the total server-wide size of the threadpool used for the health check workers
CacheSocacheReadSize	The CSELF directive sets the minimum amount of data, in bytes, to be read from the backend before the data is sent to the client. The default of zero causes all data read of any size to be passed downstream to the client immediately as it arrives. Setting this to a higher value causes the disk cache to buffer at least this amount before sending the result to the client. This can improve performance when caching content from a slow reverse proxy.
bulk_insert_buffer_size	Size in bytes of the per-thread cache tree used to speed up bulk inserts into MyISAM and Aria tables. A value of 0 disables the cache tree.

join_buffer_size	Minimum size in bytes of the buffer used for queries that cannot use an index, and instead perform a full table scan. Increase to get faster full joins when adding indexes is not possible, although be aware of memory issues, since joins will always allocate the minimum size. Best left low globally and set high in sessions that require large full joins.
join_buffer_space_limit	Maximum size in bytes of the query buffer, By default 1024*128*10. See Block-based join algorithms.

Increase if you perform many sequential scans. If not in a multiple of 4KB, will be rounded down to the nearest multiple. Also used in ORDER BY's for caching indexes in a temporary file (not temporary table), for caching results of nested queries, for bulk inserts into partitions, and to determine the memory block size of MEMORY tables.
read_rnd_buffer_size	Size in bytes of the buffer used when reading rows from a MyISAM table in sorted order after a key sort. Larger values improve ORDER BY performance, although rather increase the size by SESSION where the need arises to avoid excessive memory use. 
rowid_merge_buff_size	The maximum size in bytes of the memory available to the Rowid-merge strategy.
sort_buffer_size	Each session performing a sort allocates a buffer with this amount of memory.

dns_children	The maximum number of processes spawn to service DNS name lookups. If you limit it too few Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of requests, slowing it down. If you allow too many they will use RAM and other system resources noticably. The maximum this may be safely set to is 32.
location_rewrite_children	The number of location rewriting processes to spawn. If you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of URLs, slowing it down. If you start too many they will use RAM and other system resources.
maximum_object_size_in_memory	Objects greater than this size will not be attempted to kept in the memory cache. This should be set high enough to keep objects accessed frequently in memory to improve performance whilst low enough to keep larger objects from hoarding cache_mem.
store_id_children	Specifies the maximum number of StoreID helper processes that Squid may spawn and several related options. Using too few of these helper processes creates request queues. Using too many helpers wastes your system resources.
url_rewrite_children	Specifies the maximum number of redirector processes that Squid may spawn and several related options. Using too few of these helper processes creates request queues. Using too many helpers wastes your system resources.
socket.txBufSize	The socket send buffer size in bytes.
socket.appReadBufSize	Each connection that is opened up in Tomcat get associated with a read buffer. This attribute controls the size of this buffer. By default this read buffer is sized at 8192 bytes. For lower concurrency, you can increase this to buffer more data. For an extreme amount of keep alive connections, decrease this number or increase your heap size.
socket.appWriteBufSize	Each connection that is opened up in Tomcat get associated with a write buffer. This attribute controls the size of this buffer. By default this write buffer is sized at 8192 bytes. For low concurrency you can increase this to buffer more response data. For an extreme amount of keep alive connections, decrease this number or increase your heap size. The default value here is pretty low, you should up it if you are not dealing with tens of thousands concurrent connections.
pollerThreadCount	Number of threads used to poll kept alive connections.
acceptCount	The maximum queue length for incoming connection requests when all possible request processing threads are in use. Any requests received when the queue is full will be refused. The default value is 100.
acceptorThreadCount	The number of threads to be used to accept connections.
maxLogMessageBufferSize	Log message buffers are usually recycled and re-used. To prevent excessive memory usage, if a buffer grows beyond this size it will be discarded. The default is 256 characters. This should be set to larger than the typical access log message size.
utilityThreads	The number of threads this Service will use for various utility tasks, including recurring ones. The special value of 0 will result in the value of Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() being used. Negative values will result in Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() + value being used unless this is less than 1 in which case 1 thread will be used. The default value is 1.
